Lesson 6 for Foundations in Computational Plant Sciences (NRT-IMPACTS). <br>

This lesson plan was designed as part of the course Forum in Computational Plant Sciences, in the Spring of 2020. This course focuses on STEM education as it pertains to computational plant sciences. The redesign of lesson 6 from the course Foundations in Computational Plant Sciences is the capstone project for this course.
